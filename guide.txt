Then user guesses the letter
If the letter is correct, replace the dash with the letter
If the letter is incorrect, the dash is mantained
4. Creating the word constructor

Push it to the array of chosen word
Split the array 
Word: Used to create an object representing the current word the user is attempting to guess. This should contain word specific logic and data.
